                <p>Since the age of 15 I have been a certified “gym rat”. I fell in love with strength training at an early age because it helped me overcome a body image complex. Plus it paid off in a big way while playing football and cricket. Adhering to an exercise program taught me discipline and consistency. Both of these habits helped me gain some financial freedom as an entrepreneur .

                <h3>
                    Consistency with an exercise program is key and I can help you with that. I guarantee it.

                    After spending 12 years in Dhaka as a network radio executive and entrepreneur, I realized that I needed to pursue more meaningful work that was in line with my core values of health and fitness. I experienced the toll of entrepreneurship and how the stress of operating a business could negatively impact your overall health, especially your fitness. So I sold my company, took some time off and launched a personal training business in Dhaka that followed me to Boulder, CO.
